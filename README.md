# Perturbing Scattering Resonances in Non-Hermitian Systems: A Generalized Wigner-Smith Operator Formulation

This repository reproduces the figures presented in the publication:  
**"Perturbing Scattering Resonances in Non-Hermitian Systems: A Generalized Wigner-Smith Operator Formulation."**

All figures can be generated using the Jupyter Notebook: `ws_paper_figures.ipynb`.

## Prerequisites

To run the notebook, you will need the **Complex Network Library**.  
You can find the library [here](https://github.com/Optical-Theory-Group/networklibrary).
